# Face Mask Detection Using YOLOv10s
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting the status of face mask usage in real-time using the YOLOv10s model. The system classifies individuals into three categories:

* With Mask – Properly wearing a face mask.

* Without Mask – No face mask detected.

* Mask Worn Incorrectly – The mask is not worn correctly (e.g., below the nose).
## 🔍 Introduction
### Input:
* Live Video Stream (via webcam)

* Image Files (JPG, PNG, etc.)

### Output:
* Annotated Video Stream (with bounding boxes and labels: "With Mask", "Without Mask", "Incorrect Mask")

* Detection Confidence Score

* Processed images/videos with bounding boxes
## 📁 Introducing the dataset
The dataset used is “Face Mask Detection-2 Computer Vision
Project”, which consists of 4,976 images collected from Roboflow. The dataset includes 3 labels:
“Incorrect_Mask”, “With_Mask” and “Without_Mask”, each label is clearly annotated
. The data is divided into three sets: train, validation and test, with the number of images being 3,790
for the training set, 732 for the validation set and 454 for the test set, respectively.

## ⏱️ Predict in real time
This video uses a laptop webcam to predict whether a person is wearing a mas

## 📸 Predict in images
The predicted image will display the corresponding prediction results. Users just need to upload the image, and the model will classify the mask-wearing status of the person in the image (correct, incorrect, or no mask).
